The design of the Rhize Manufacturing Data Hub comes from decades of work in industrial automation.
Time and again, we discovered data infrastructure and level-3 systems with the same problems:
- They don't scale across organizations
- They don't integrate with existing systems
- They fundamentally don't respect the complexity of the manufacturing problem space.

This experience led us to build the system that we always wished existed: the Manufacturing Data Hub.
These topics explain the concepts, architecture, and design philosophy that underpin the design of Rhize.
