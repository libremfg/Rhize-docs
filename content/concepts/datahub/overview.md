## Overview

Multi-site manufacturing businesses have a data governance problem.

If they implement data governance centrally, it's really difficult to get the people at each site aligned and in agreement.
This leads to centrally governed reports that site personnel don't use worse, are inaccurate.

If they implement data governance at the site level, it is difficult to align data centrally to enable applications and analytics to be built once and deployed many times across sites.

The DataHub is an approach to data management that solves this challenge. The DataHub is a standardized data schema and information platform that can be deployed at each site.
It's follows the ISA95 International Standard for Manufacturing Data Modelling.
The DataHub platform includes an engine that lets local data management teams build ingestion pipelines from local data sources into a standardised data model, achieving a sustainable blend of centralised data governance and
site-based data management.
