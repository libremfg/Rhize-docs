These diagrams provide some highly simplified visual explanations gleaned from parts of the thorough [ISA-95 standard](https://www.isa.org/store?query=isa95).
To read about how the standard fits within the data architecture of Rhize, read our blog post [Rethinking perspectives on ISA-95](https://rhize.com/blog/reframing-perspective-on-isa95/).

## Information exchange between models and levels

This diagram shows how information exchanges between resource models and systems.
It is a highly simplified view of some flows described in parts 2 and 4 of the standard.
Each entity in the diagram carries information in multiple dimensions, including:
- The entity's position in the resource model (as shown by vertical orientation and color)
- Its relationship to other entities
- Its role in the integration between level-3 and level-4 systems.

## Overview of relations, levels, and stages

This diagram shows the top-level relations of manufacturing entities in level-3 and level-4 systems across different stages of production. 
These entities and their relationships also represent some foundational objects in the Rhize data model (exposed through the Rhize [GraphQL Interface](/how-to/gql/)).
