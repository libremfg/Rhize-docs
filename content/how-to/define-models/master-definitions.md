To make a production object visible to the Rhize data hub, you must define it as a data model.

These sections document all the objects that you can add through the UI, and the fields and properties that you can associate with them.
All these models are based on the ISA-95 standard, mostly from [Part 2](https://www.isa.org/products/ansi-isa-95-00-02-2018-enterprise-control-system-i), which describes the role-based equipment hierarchy.



## Global object fields

All objects that you define must have a unique name.
Additionally, most objects have the following fields:

| Global field | Description                                                                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version      | The version of the object (and each version has a [state](#version-states))              |
| Description  | Freeform text to describe what the object does and help colleagues understand its role |

### Version states

Each version of an object can have the following states:
- `Draft`
- `Active`
- `For review`
- `Deprecated`

## Equipment


A piece of _equipment_ is a tool with a defined role in a [process segment](#process-segment).
For example, in a baking process, equipment might be a specific brownie oven.

Along with the following fields, you can also connect an equipment item to a [data source](#data-source), add additional properties, and toggle it to be active or inactive.

{{% introTable.inline "equipment" %}}
{{ $term := (.Get 0) }}
{{ $vowels := slice "a" "e" "i" "o" "u" }}
Along with the [global object fields](#global-object-fields),
{{cond (in $vowels (index (split (lower $term) "") 0 )) "an" "a" }}
{{ $term }} object has the following fields:
{{% /introTable.inline %}}

| Inherit personnel classes | One ore more personnel classes to inherit properties from  |
| Operational location      | The associated [Operational location](#operation-location) |

## Personnel Class

A _personnel class_ is a grouping of persons whose work shares a definite purpose in the manufacturing process.
In a baking process, an example of a personnel class may be `oven_operators`.

{{% introTable.inline "personnel class" /%}}

| General fields  | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hierarchy scope | The [hierarchy scope](#hierarchy-scope) within which this personnel exchanges data |

## Operational Location

An _operational location_ is where resources are expected to be located in a plant.
For example, in a baking process, an operational location class may be `northwing_kitchen_A`

{{% introTable.inline "operational location" /%}}

| General fields               | Description                                                                       |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Operational Location Class

An _operational location_ class is a grouping of [operational locations](#operational-locations) for a defined purpose.
For example, in a baking process, an operational location class may be `Kitchens`

{{% introTable.inline "operational location class" /%}}

| General fields                     | Description                                                                                  |

| Inherit Operational location class | The Operational location classes to inherit properties from                       |



## Physical Asset

A _physical asset_ is portable or swappable equipment.
In a baking process, a physical asset might be the laser jet printer which adds labels to the boxes (and could be used in many segments across the plant).

In many cases, your process may need to model only [equipment](#equipment), not physical assts.



## Physical asset class

A _physical asset class_ is a class of [physical assets](#physical-assets).

The physical asset class has properties for:
- ClassType
- Value
- Unit of measure


## Operations Definition

An _operations definition_ defines the resources required to perform an operation, including for production, quality, maintenance, and inventory, from the perspective of the level-4 enterprise control systems.

{{% introTable.inline "operations definition" /%}}

| General fields  | Description                                                                                     |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operation type  | One of: ` Inventory`, `maintenance`, `mixed`, `production`, `quality`                           |
| Hierarchy scope | The [hierarchy scope](#hierarchy-scope) within which data is exchanged for this operations definition |


## Hierarchy Scope

The _hierarchy scope_ represents the scope within which data information is exchanged. For example, in a baking process, two plants may have different personnel and equipment, even if they both produce the identical final products.
The hierarchy scope defines a scope where all granular data within is relevant to it.

While hierarchy scope is often connected to an [operational location](#operational-location), the determining is about _information exchange_.

## Units of Measure {#uom}

A _Unit of measure_ is a defined unit to consistely compare values, duratation or quantities.

You can create units of measure in the UI and give them the following parameters:
- Name
- Data type

## Process segment

A _process segment_ is a step in a manufacturing activity that is visible to a business process, grouping the necessary personnel, material, equipment, and physical assets.
In a baking process, an example segment might be `mixing`.

You can associate specifications for:
- Equipment, Material, Personnel, and Physical Assets

{{% introTable.inline "Process segment" /%}}

| General fields           | Description                                                                   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operations type          | One of: ` Inventory`, `maintenance`, `mixed`, `production`, `quality`         |
| Definition type          | One of: Instance, Pattern                                                     |
| Duration                 | The expected duration                                                         |
| Duration unit of measure | The time [unit of measure](#uom)                                              |
| Hierarchy scope          | The [hierarchy scope](#hierarchy-scope) within which data is exchanged for this process segment |

You can add additional parameters for:
- Name
- Value
- Unit of measure

## Work Master

A _work master_ is a template for a job order from the perspective of the level-3 (MES/MOM) systems.
In a baking process, an example work master might be `Brownie Recipe`.

{{% introTable.inline "work master" /%}}

| General fields           | Description                                                                   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Workflow type            | One of: ` Inventory`, `maintenance`, `mixed`, `production`, `quality` |
| Workflow specification   | An associated BPMN workflow                                           |
