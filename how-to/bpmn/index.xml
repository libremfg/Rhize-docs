For example, you can use BPMN to coordinate messages between systems, create alerts and events, transform incoming work orders into their ISA-95 representation, and store them in the Rhize DB.
Each workflow is configured through the same high-level process:
Set a start condition that initiates the workflow. This condition may be a value from a data source or MQTT message, a scheduled timer, or a button pressed in frontend app.</description></item><item><title>Create workflows</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/create-workflow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 14:50:39 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/create-workflow/</guid><description>This topic shows you how to use the BPMN UI to create event-driven workflows. To view the full list of elements and their parameters, refer to BPMN elements.
Prerequisites To create a workflow, you&amp;rsquo;ll need:
An installed environment Topics to publish and subscribe to The ability to call the GraphQL API and understand JSON. General procedures Every workflow is different, but the overall procedure usually works like this:
Create a start event:</description></item><item><title>Tune BPMN performance</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/tune-performance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2024 09:47:47 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/tune-performance/</guid><description>This page documents some tips to debug BPMN workflows and improve their performance.
Manufacturing events can generate a vast amount of data. And a BPMN workflow can have any number of logical flows and data transformations. So an inefficient BPMN process can introduce performance degradations.
Manage the process context size Note The max size of the process variable context comes from the default max payload size of NATS Jetstreams. To increase this size, change your NATS configuration.</description></item><item><title>BMPN elements</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/bpmn-elements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 11:10:37 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/bpmn-elements/</guid><description>These pages describe the elements to make a Rhize BPMN workflow, and their parameters to set conditions, use variables, and call services.
Rhize BPMN elements are based on the Business Process Model and Notation OMG Standard. While the visual grammar is functionally the same, we extend some elements for specific Rhize features, like service tasks that call the GraphQL API.
Each BPMN workflow is a process with an ID. Each process is made up events (circles), activities (rectangles), gateways (diamonds), and flows (arrows).</description></item></channel></rss>
