Prerequisites To add a data source, you need the following:
Access to an MQTT or OPC UA server Credentials for this server, if necessary The URL and connection string for this server (Rhize will point to this) Steps to connect The process has two sides:
Sending topics from your MQTT, OPCUA, or NATS server to Rhize.</description></item><item><title>Turn values into events</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/publish-subscribe/turn-value-into-event/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 19:10:43 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/publish-subscribe/turn-value-into-event/</guid><description>A data source can emit a high volume of data, but not all this data is useful. To filter for significant events, use the rules engine to write rules to that trigger workflows when conditions are met.
The rules engine evaluates incoming values from a data source and converts significant changes into events to be processed by a BPMN workflow. Each rule exists on the level of the equipment class. Each rule evaluates changes that happen to a set of specified properties for a data source.</description></item><item><title>Tutorial: Trigger a workflow from a rule</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/publish-subscribe/tutorial-create-equipment-class-rule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 11:39:29 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/publish-subscribe/tutorial-create-equipment-class-rule/</guid><description>An equipment class rule triggers a BPMN workflow whenever a data source publishes a value that meets a specified threshold.
Imagine a scenario when an oven must be preheated every time a new order number is published to an MQTT edge device. You could automate this workflow with a rule that listens to messages published and evaluates a condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the rule triggers a BPMN workflow to preheat the oven.</description></item><item><title>Track changes (CDC)</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/publish-subscribe/track-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/publish-subscribe/track-changes/</guid><description>You can use change data capture (CDC) to track data changes over time, including a mutation or drop in your database. Rhize&amp;rsquo;s CDC implementation can use Kafka, NATS, or a local file as a sink to store CDC updates streamed by Rhize&amp;rsquo;s Alpha leader nodes.
When CDC is enabled, Rhize streams events for:
All set and delete mutations, except those that affect password fields Drop events. Live Loader events are recorded by CDC, but Bulk Loader events aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item></channel></rss>
