Manufacturing events can generate a vast amount of data. And a BPMN workflow can have any number of logical flows and data transformations. So an inefficient BPMN process can introduce performance degradations.
Avoid parallel gateways Running processes in parallel can increase the workflow&amp;rsquo;s complexity by an order of magnitude. Parallel joins, in particular, can also increase memory usage of the NATS service.</description></item><item><title>Create workflows</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/create-workflow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 14:50:39 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/create-workflow/</guid><description>This topic shows you how to use the BPMN UI to create event-driven workflows. To view the full list of elements and their parameters, refer to BPMN elements.
Prerequisites To create a workflow, you&amp;rsquo;ll need:
An installed environment Topics to publish and subscribe to The ability to call the GraphQL API and understand JSON. General procedures Every workflow is different, but the overall procedure usually works like this:

Rhize BPMN elements are based on the Business Process Model and Notation OMG Standard. While the visual grammar is functionally the same, we extend some elements for specific Rhize features, like service tasks that call the GraphQL API.
Each BPMN workflow is a process with an ID. Each process is made up events (circles), activities (rectangles), gateways (diamonds), and flows (arrows).</description></item></channel></rss>
