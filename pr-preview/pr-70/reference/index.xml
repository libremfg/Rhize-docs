It works by connecting to equipment or groups of equipment that run over protocols such as OPC UA.
As the communication bridge between the Rhize Data Hub and your plant, the agent has multiple functions:
It subscribes to tags and republishes the changes in NATS. It creates an interface for the BPMN engine to send reads and writes to a data source and its associated equipment.</description></item><item><title>GraphQL filters</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/reference/gql-filters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/reference/gql-filters/</guid><description>This page provides a bare reference of filter queries accepted by the Rhize database.

This glossary is a reference of how Rhize defines terms used in this documentation.
Agent The Rhize agent bridges your plant processes with the Rhize data hub. It collects data that is emitted during the manufacturing process and publishes it to the NATS message broker. Andon A system that alerts manufacturing teams about problems in processes or quality. Audit The Libre Audit log server is a service that provides a tamper-proof and immutable audit trail of all events that occur in the Rhize system.</description></item></channel></rss>
