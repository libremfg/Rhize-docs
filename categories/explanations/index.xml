In another phrasing, this article explains why Rhize made the choices it did to become the world&amp;rsquo;s first manufacturing data hub. For introductory explanations about Rhize in particular, read What is Rhize? and How Rhize works.

Rhize is designed to scale to the largest organizations, integrate with legacy systems, and address the complex reality of manufacturing head on. These to do this, these are our explicit design goals:
Provide a highly reliable means to collect manufacturing data from varied sources. Standardize this data in a way that accurately places it within an event in the context of an entire manufacturing operation.</description></item></channel></rss>
