These sections document all the objects that you can add through the UI, and the fields and properties that you can associate with them. All these models are based on the ISA-95 standard, mostly from Part 2, which describes the role-based equipment hierarchy.
Global object fields All objects that you define must have a unique name.</description></item><item><title>Default URLs and local ports</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/reference/default-ports/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 16:49:42 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/reference/default-ports/</guid><description>After you install Rhize services, they are accessible, by default, on the following ports:

It works by connecting to equipment or groups of equipment that run over protocols such as OPC UA.
As the communication bridge between the Rhize Data Hub and your plant, the agent has multiple functions:
It subscribes to tags and republishes the changes in NATS. It creates an interface for the BPMN engine to send reads and writes to a data source and its associated equipment.</description></item><item><title>GraphQL types and filters</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/reference/gql-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/reference/gql-types/</guid><description>This page provides a reference of the data types enforced by the Rhize database schema, and of the filters that can apply to these types when you query, update, or delete a set of resources. For an extended guide, with examples, read Use query filters.
Note These filters are based on Rhize&amp;rsquo;s implementation of the Dgraph @search directives. Data types Every object in the Rhize schema has fields that are of one of the basic data types.</description></item><item><title>Glossary</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/reference/glossary/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 19:35:35 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/reference/glossary/</guid><description>The manufacturing industry has many specialized termsâ€”and many abbreviations. This glossary is a reference of how Rhize defines terms used in this documentation.
Agent The Rhize agent bridges your plant processes with the Rhize data hub. It collects data that is emitted during the manufacturing process and publishes it to the NATS message broker.Andon A system that alerts manufacturing teams about problems in processes or quality.Audit The Libre Audit log server is a service that provides a tamper-proof and immutable audit trail of all events that occur in the Rhize system.</description></item><item><title>Naming conventions</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/naming-conventions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/naming-conventions/</guid><description>Note These are recommendations. Your organization may adapt the conventions to its needs. Each BPMN workflow has an ID, as does each node in the workflow. Rhize recommends adopting a set of conventions about how you name these elements. Standardizing BPMN names across an environment has multiple benefits:
Consistent workflow naming conventions help you filter and find workflows in the process list. Well-named nodes make the workflow behavior easier to understand at a glance.</description></item><item><title>BMPN elements</title><link>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/bpmn-elements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 11:10:37 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.rhize.com/how-to/bpmn/bpmn-elements/</guid><description>These pages describe the elements to make a Rhize BPMN workflow, and their parameters to set conditions, use variables, and call services.
Rhize BPMN elements are based on the Business Process Model and Notation OMG Standard. While the visual grammar is functionally the same, we extend some elements for specific Rhize features, like service tasks that call the GraphQL API.
Each BPMN workflow is a process with an ID. Each process is made up events (circles), activities (rectangles), gateways (diamonds), and flows (arrows).</description></item></channel></rss>
